    <h3>What is CR7 favorite car?</h3>
    <p>
        CR7 is a big fan of go-fast machines, so you can see why he instantly fell in love with the <strong>Ferrari F12 TDF</strong>. As with most of Ronaldo's cars, the F12 TDF is rare, with the Italian carmaker building only 799 examples. The F12 TDF cost around <em>$434,998</em>, and it's not even near the most expensive car in his garage.</p>
